## News Homepage Project

I created this React app to go along with this challenge from [Front-end Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl/hub).

It uses all custom CSS besides a small grid framework called [Flexbox Grid](http://flexboxgrid.com/).

I still need to work on mobile responsiveness but this is the first start.
